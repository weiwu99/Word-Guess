# Word-Guess
A hangman game with 3 mode: interactive, simple, and clever mode.

Interactive: Player 1 chooses a word and Player 2 has to guess it before getting hanged.

Simple: The secret keep randomly chooses a word from a given dictionary, and the guesser chooses a letter based on its English frequency

Clever: The secret keeper can change to a new word after each guess. The new word has to satisfy previous guessed patterns. The guesser chooses the letter with the highest frequency among remaining possible words (that satisfies previous patterns).
