This project implements the game of Breakout.

### Timeline

Start Date: 09/05/2021

Finish Date: 09/07/2021

Hours Spent: 25 hours


### Tutorial and other Resources Used
Specific tutorials of Java syntax and data structure tricks are all in the respective comments.
I also used the debugger tutorials to identify problems in my CleverKeeper and CleverGuesser classes.

### Resource Attributions

The parimary resources I have used are code recourses from lab hangman and debugger repository, and
a few links about Java syntax from StackOverFlow and GFG. 

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: 11 hangman images, lowerwords.txt, small.txt

Key/Mouse inputs: for InteractiveGuesser, keyboard inputs for typing the secret words

Known Bugs:
The winrate for CleverGuesser seems pretty low, and I am not entirely sure if that is the nature of CleverKeeper. 


### Notes/Assumptions
The input file should have all letters lowercase (despite my toLowerCase(), I am totally sure if it is case-insensitive)

### Impressions

This assignment gives me an opportunity to recognize how important refactoring and debugging tools are. My work efficiency improved a lot from refactoring my code 
compared to breakout, and refactoring really helps me have a better understanding of my own code structure because now my code is much more organized. It also helped me 
track my bugs when I am using a debugger because now I only need to identify particular issues from one method instead of looking through hundreds of lines of code.
